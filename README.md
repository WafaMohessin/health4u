## Lessons Learned
​
While building this app we faced some challenges along the way. The API we selected has some limitations on filtering, so we had to adjust our app to work within those limitations.  
This project also helped us learn how to better work with other developers and how to solve merge conflicts. Working together on a single page can be challenging, but with open communication solving problems is easy.
